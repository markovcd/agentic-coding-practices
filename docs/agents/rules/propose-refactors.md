# Propose refactors

## Say so when the code has outgrown its shape

When the code a task works in has gone untidy, ballooned out of proportion to what it does, or would plainly read better shaped another way, propose the refactor. Do not wait to be asked, and do not quietly work around it.

**Why:** code that has drifted gets worse one careful patch at a time, and the session working in it is the one that sees it most clearly.

**How to apply:**

- Signs: a method or class that has doubled while doing one thing, a flag threaded through four layers, the same few lines in three places, a file that needs scrolling to find the part being changed, a change that had to touch far more than it should.
- Check `docs/adr/` and the file's own header first (the `adrs` skill): a shape a decision chose, or a refactor one declined, is not drift. The refactors worth proposing are where code has drifted from a decision the repo made, or where a pattern the repo established was never carried through. Grep before claiming the second: a pattern that looks unfinished may already have been extended elsewhere.
- Rank by lines of code, not total lines; comments can be a third to two thirds of a file.
- Finish the task in the code as it stands, then end the reply with the proposal: what hurts, in a line, and the shape it should take. Name the files.
- It is a proposal. Do not refactor unasked, and do not fold it into the task's commit. When the user agrees, do it as its own commit, or add it to `TODO.md` if it is for later.
- Say it once. A proposal the user declined, or one already in `TODO.md`, is not raised again.
